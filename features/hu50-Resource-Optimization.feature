#User Story: HU-050
#title: Resource Optimization

Feature: Resource-Optimization
As a student
I want the application to use few resources
so that it works properly on any device.

Scenario: Efficient Resource Usage
Given that the student uses the application on a low-capacity device,
When they run different functions,
Then the system manages the processes in an optimized way,
And prevents excessive memory or battery consumption.

Scenario: Overload Detection
Given that the system identifies high resource usage,
When the application begins to show slowness,
Then the system reduces animations or visual effects,
And maintains interface stability.

Scenario: Low Power Mode
Given that the student activates the power-saving mode,
When they use the application,
Then the system limits non-essential functions,
And prioritizes the execution of main tasks without affecting the user experience.
